This package was quickly hacked together because I needed a menu on the command line to quickly launch the Proxmox vm in virtViewer



To install:

sudo pacman -S virt-viewer 

python -m venv vdiclientenv
source vdiclientenv/bin/activate
pip install proxmoxer
pip install requests


Go to your proxmox interface and setup a user on Proxmox Datacenter

next setup an api key for this user (copy to vdiclient.ini)
setup rights for this user to start/stop VM/LXC
setup rights to each container you want to give access to

edit your vdiclient.ini add your server

add a /etc/hosts entry to point to your server

proxmox.local	192.168.1.123

./vdiclient.py
